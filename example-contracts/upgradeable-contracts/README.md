# Upgradeable Contracts

There are three upgradeable contract examples in this folder, they differ
in key properties outlined below.

See [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies) for
more information on proxy patterns.


## [`forward-calls`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples/upgradeable-contracts/forward-calls)

* Forwards any call that does not match a selector of itself to another contract.
* The other contract needs to be deployed on-chain.
* State is stored in the storage of the contract to which calls are forwarded.


## [`delegate-calls`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples/upgradeable-contracts/delegate-calls)

* Executes any call that does not match a selector of itself with the code of another contract.
* The other contract does not need to be deployed on-chain.
* State is stored in the storage of the originally called contract.


## [`set-code-hash`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples/upgradeable-contracts/set-code-hash)

* Updates the contract code using `set_code_hash`.
  This effectively replaces the code which is executed for the contract address.
* The other contract (`updated-incrementer`) needs to be deployed on-chain.
* State is stored in the storage of the originally instantiated contract (`incrementer`).
